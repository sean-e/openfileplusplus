# OpenFile++
OpenFile++ is a simple file opener.  
The installer adds it to the Windows Startup group so that it runs automatically on login.  It is hidden by default.  

## Usage
- Press Ctrl+Shift+O or click the program icon in the taskbar tray to open the window.
- By default, the list is populated with files in your Documents, Downloads, and Desktop directories (but not sub-directories by default).
- Start typing to find a file in the list.  You can enter multiple terms separated by a space.  If only a single item is left in the list, press enter to open it in the associated application.
- Use up/down/page-up/page-down to change selection in the list.
- Press enter to open the selected item(s).
- Press Ctrl+N to add individual files to the list.
- Press Ctrl+D to add the contents of other directies to the list.
- Edit the list (Edit | Edit source list) to remove or deactive items, or to make directory searches include sub-directories.
